# Heidelberg Engineering XML Format

While eyepy can read most information from the XML format, a comprehensive documentation is still missing. If you are interested in contributing to eyepy, documenting a file format is a great way to get started. If you are interested, contac us via GitHub by opening an [issue](https://github.com/MedVisBonn/eyepy/issues).
